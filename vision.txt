My Task Manager aim is to develop a Human-Centric Workflow Task List Manager Wrapper in order to give better usability
experience to business users. It will provide a user interface based on extjs library and a set of back-end classes
templates and data format views to translate session beans generated for such classes into front-end understandable JSON
objects.
Any BPMS or Workflow engine producer who needs a Human Task List Manager may customize and extend My Task Manager to
fulfill their needs.
An example code is placed for Intalio BPMS at http://whatabout.wordpress.com blog.
